# Clicky Game

## Overview

A memory game application using React. The application renders different images to the screen and listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time and resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

1. Check out the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.


5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.

#### Hints

* Begin by building a non-functioning static version for your Clicky Game. Then work on making the game interactive.
