# Clicky Memory Game

A memory game application using React. The application displays images to the screen and listens for click events.

When images are clicked, the application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time and resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle on the screen in a random order. If the user clicks the same image more than once, the game should restart.
